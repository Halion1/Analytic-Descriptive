## Quarto

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| label: simple_calc
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Another example:

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(diamonds,aes(x=carat,y=price)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1)
```

As we've seen before, include: false will suppress the code AND the output when rendering.

```{r}
#| include: false
2 * 2
```

There are `r nrow(diamonds)` rows in the diamonds dataframe.
