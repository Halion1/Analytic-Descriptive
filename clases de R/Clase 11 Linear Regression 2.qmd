```{r}
salary = read_csv("Salary_Data.csv")
```

```{r}
str(salary)
summary(salary)
```

Look at correlation.

```{r}
ggcorr(salary, label = TRUE, label_round = 2)
```

All of the variables are highly correlated with each other. This is a concerning sign.

```{r}
mod1 = lm(Salary ~ YearsExperience, salary)
summary(mod1)
```

```{r}
mod2 = lm(Salary ~ Age, salary)
summary(mod2)
```

What happens when we try to enhance the model by adding both variables are predictors?

```{r}
mod3 = lm(Salary ~ YearsExperience + Age, salary)
summary(mod3)
```

This is an extreme case of multicollinearity. In other cases we would look for the following:

1.  Incorrect signs (signs flip from the proper direction to the incorrect direction)
2.  Poor p-values for one or more variables

Easiest way to address multicollinearity is to eliminate the weaker of the variables.
